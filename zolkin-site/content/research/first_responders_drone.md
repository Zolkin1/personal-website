title: Custom Drone for First Responders
---

## Description
I was creating a custom built drone that is optimized for use by first responders. The goal was to build a drone that can take off after an upside down landing, stabilize its position indoors without GPS, and function in complete darkness all while gathering critical information for first responders. I generated requirements, wrote specifications, wrote code, designed and soldered electronics, and modeled, fabriacted, and built a custom drone. This was a solo project where I performed all of the design, implementation, and testing of the quadcopter. This project has been an amazing learning experience where I have improved my engineering skills and learned to make solutions that are robust and accurate.
