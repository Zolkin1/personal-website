## Welcome!
<!--more-->

I have recently update my website to have a more modern and sleek feel. Furthermore, it should be easier for me to update it so the information is accurate at all times.

I hope to keep this blog updated as I have time. In general, I plan to anounce new software tools and open source projects here. I also expect to post additional musing or things that I find useful or interesting.

The research tab above will hold (relatively) up to date information about my research projects inculding brief overviews and links to relavent code and papers.
